            <p class="description">Workshop -Exploring Free Games <br>
            During the lesson, my lecturer wants us to explore free games and the first game I tried was nitronic rush. I chose the game
          as it was introduced by my teacher and was apparently create by another student for their assignment.
        The game was a racing game where you need to reach the end goal. There is a timer to time your runs so you can try to reach the end 
      with the minimun time spent to challenge yourself. The game have a few mechanics where you can jump, flip and even boost the car I am playing on.
    I enjoyed the game as it is something new and I am playing a game created by a student which looks to me is a very complicated game where a student would not 
  even think of ever creating at their current knowledge I was blown away.
I did not enjoy the game after a while as it was repetitive and not multiplayer as I love to challenge people instead of playing a single player game.
I would improve the game by adding multiplayer and a online scoreboard to see who can finish with the least number of time but that itself is very complex. </p>

            <p class="description">Your player Motivation Profile<br>
            Today I did a player motivation profile to see what kind of player I am and see if they got the player type right in my opinion.
          The motivation profile match my own unstanding of why I play different type of games and know what kind if games suits me too.
        There are a few games I would like to try from the motivational profile but so far I do not see any game I do not enjoy.
      Among to top 10 recommended games for me, I see around 7 of them I play.
    I did enjoy the 7 games and is still playing them every so often but as there are more assignments, I have lesser and lesser time play my games.
    The games I have not played interest me as I have been wanting to play them for a while but lack the money to but them to play.</p>

            <p class="description">Game Genres<br>
            I tend to enjoy First Person Shooter games and I am good at games that requires me to aim and kill enemies. I love high action games and most games 
          that have action are mostly First Person Shooter games. I also love to play puzzel games as after completing a complex puzzels, I tend to have a sense of accomplishment as 
        I have just finish a hard puzzel and feel good about myself.
      I do not like to play horror games and I do not like the feeling of being jumpscared and I feel like I would be afraid of the dark like when I was little if I play too much.</p>

            <p class="description">Board Games<br>
            On this day my lecturer allowed us to play boad games in class to familiarise ourselves with board games so we can have more ideas for our assignemnts.
            The first board game I played was 5 minute marvel which was a board game about defeatinng the Boss and his minions in 5 minutes, a team game.
            I do not like the game as it is a game that is on a timer and we need to cooperate with other people instead of going against them. I do not like the game as it is also luck based and there are cases where
            we are not able to do anything at all.<br> I also played another game called Incan Gold where it is a game where you gamble on seeing if you are lucky or not. The end goal is to see who is able to collect the most resources.
            This is Very fun to us as we are able to challenge one another to see who is able collect the most and who is the best and the luckiest inthe group.

            This is another day where the lecturer allow us to play board games so that those who did not turn up for class on the previous lesson have another chance to try
            out different board games. On this day the first game I played was Avalon, Avalon is a fun game where I have played before and it is a game about trust and lies.
            The bad guys would try to fail the mission so that they are able to win the game while the good guys would want to get at least 3 mission done so that they can win.
            It is fun as there are communication and trying to fool one another, a really fun experience.<br> The other game we played was King of Tokyo where we would try to eliminate other opponents.
            We can win when we gather 20 points or be the last one standing. It is very fun as we are having a fun time to discuss a plan to defeat one other guy and try to help and destroy each other at the same time.
            If I could, I would like to play the game again.

              In the end, we decided on Ching Heng's work to work on which is a card game about bidding and trading.

              On the same day we Decided to go to my house the next day to meet up to create our prototype.
              We also updated our google doc with the game idea to show our teacher
              so that he could have another look at our game to see if there is any huge issues with it and get his general idea on it.</p>

               to cut the printed paper to test our game with the paper prototype. We encountered a lot of 
               issues with the game which resulted in us arguing what to change and why to change and what
                we feel like is needed and not needed in the game. Afterwards we also went to buy some card sleeves to
                 protect our card from being damaged for the final design.</p>

              I brought the prototype to school to use the lesson time during the game production 
              class to test and see if there are any error with the playing cards and ask for opinion from our tutor again during class in person. During this
              time we decided to change a huge portion of our
              game to make it shorter and more enjoyable to people playing the game. From roughly 
              40 minutes of game play to around 20 minutes.</p>

            <p class="description">Assignment 1 Diary <br>On this day me and my team went to the school
               printer to print out the card design there as the school printer have a good colour
                printer which make our card design looks good.  We do have some printing error where there
                 are some paper printed with the wrong name but we use my home printer to print another copy
                  of it to fix the issue. We used my printer which does not have amazing colour like the school printer
                   to fix minor error but it did its job well. On this day we also discovered a lot of issue with the game itself
                    as there are a lot of loop holes in the game where we missed and is currently in a rush to
                     fix. We also remove a few card we agreed were to overpowered and after this we decided
                       our game is finished. We agreed to meet up at my house to test our game for the last
                        time and finished the rest of the task.</p>

                 will look like and what is needed in the book. We do not want the rule book to look dull and also
                  do not want the book to be too lengthy looking so we decide to add pictures to aid in the rule book's looks.
                   We also spent the rest of the time at my house to record some video clips of the game play so that

                  During the school's various Values In Action (VIA) programmes, such as the Beautify Your School Programmes and I-Care Programmes, Ri Sheng demonstrated selflessness and empathy for the less fortunate by rendering his services tirelessly. Despite his school commitments, he also took time to join the Math Peer Tutoring Programme, where he helped to guide and tutor weaker students. In addition, he helped to edit his classmates’ workout videos to keep the senior citizens at Lions Home for the Elders active and entertained during COVID-19 as part of his Student-Initiated Issues Investigation-VIA project.
