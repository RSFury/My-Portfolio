            <p class="description">Workshop -Exploring Free Games <br>
            During the lesson, my lecturer tasked us to explore free games we have never tried and the first game I tried was nitronic rush. I chose the game
          as it was introduced by my teacher and was created by another student for their assignment.
        It was a racing game where your objective is to reach the end goal. There is a timer so you can try to reach the end 
      with the minimum time spent, challenging yourself. The game has a few mechanics where you can jump, flip and even boost the car.
    I enjoyed the game as it is something new.Moreover, I am playing a game created by a student which to me was an amazing feat I did not think a student can achieve and spent most of my time exploring the different
    mechanics the game have to offer.
I did not enjoy the game after a while as it was repetitive and not multiplayer as I love to challenge people instead of playing a single player game.
I would improve the game by adding multiplayer and a online scoreboard to see who can finish with the least number of time but that itself is very complex. </p>

            <p class="description">Your player Motivation Profile<br>
            Today I did a player motivation profile to see what kind of player I am and see if they got the player type right in my opinion.
          The motivation profile matched my own unstanding of why I play different type of games and what kind of games suits me too.
        There are a few games I would like to try from the motivational profile but so far I do not see any game I do not enjoy.
      Among to top 10 recommended games for me, I see around 7 I play.
    I did enjoy the 7 games and is still playing them every so often but as there are more assignments, I have lesser time play my games.
    I am interested in the rest of the games as I have an interest in them before and did not have the chance to play.</p>

            <p class="description">Game Genres<br>
            I tend to enjoy First Person Shooter games and I am good at games that requires me to aim and defeat enemies. I love high action games and most games 
          that have action are First Person Shooter games. I love to play puzzle games as after completing a complex puzzles, I tend to have a sense of accomplishment as 
        I have just finish a hard puzzle and feel good about myself.
      I do not like to play horror games as I do not like the feeling of being jumpscared.</p>

            <p class="description">Board Games<br>
            On this day my lecturer allowed us to play boad games in class to familiarise ourselves with board games so we can have more ideas for our assignemnts.
            The first board game I played was 5 minute marvel which was a board game about defeatinng the Boss and his minions in 5 minutes, a team game.
            I do not like the game as it is a game that is on a timer and we need to cooperate with other people instead of going against them. I do not like the game as it is also luck based and there are cases where
            we are not able to do anything at all.<br> I also played another game called Incan Gold where it is a game where you gamble on seeing if you are lucky or not. The end goal is to see who is able to collect the most resources.
            This is Very fun to us as we are able to challenge one another to see who is able collect the most and who is the best and the luckiest inthe group.

            <p class="description">Board Games<br>
            This is another day where the lecturer allow us to play board games so that those who did not turn up for class on the previous lesson have another chance to try
            out different board games. On this day the first game I played was Avalon, Avalon is a fun game where I have played before and it is a game about trust and lies.
            The bad guys would try to fail the mission so that they are able to win the game while the good guys would want to get at least 3 mission done so that they can win.
            It is fun as there are communication and trying to fool one another, a really fun experience.<br> The other game we played was King of Tokyo where we would try to eliminate other opponents.
            We can win when we gather 20 points or be the last one standing. It is very fun as we are having a fun time to discuss a plan to defeat one other guy and try to help and destroy each other at the same time.
            If I could, I would like to play the game again.

              We agreed to all think of a game idea and we will all pick one idea that we all like so that can choose what game we will be doing.
              We thought of different games where I thought of hunting board game Jeremy came up with a treasure board game and Ching Heng is currently thinking of a betrayal game.</p>

            <p class="description">Assignment 1 Diary <br>My group came together and started a teams call to further discuss on which game we are going to choose.
              After improving on our game on the word document, each of us take turn to explain how our game works and afterward do a vote to see who's idea is the best and we will work on that idea for our project.
              In the end, we decided on Ching Heng's work to work on which is a card game about bidding and trading.

                we proceed to do our research online to find similar games to steal some ideas from and we found some game and one of them is called Room 25</p>

            <p class="description">Assignment 1 Diary <br>After a few days of dealing with other work from other modules,
              we decided to meet up at night on the same day online to discuss on the materials
              we are going to use for our work and how the prototype design is going to look like.
              On the same day we Decided to go to my house the next day to meet up to create our prototype.
              We also updated our google doc with the game idea to show our teacher
              so that he could have another look at our game to see if there is any huge issues with it and get his general idea on it.</p>

            <p class="description">Assignment 1 Diary <br>Our group meet up at my house at around 2.30 pm
               to cut the printed paper to test our game with the paper prototype. We encountered a lot of 
               issues with the game which resulted in us arguing what to change and why to change and what
                we feel like is needed and not needed in the game. Afterwards we also went to buy some card sleeves to
                 protect our card from being damaged for the final design.</p>

            <p class="description">Assignment 1 Diary <br>When school reopened after whitespace week,
              I brought the prototype to school to use the lesson time during the game production 
              class to test and see if there are any error with the playing cards and ask for opinion from our tutor again during class in person. During this
              time we decided to change a huge portion of our
              game to make it shorter and more enjoyable to people playing the game. From roughly 
              40 minutes of game play to around 20 minutes.</p>

            <p class="description">Assignment 1 Diary <br>After solidifying most of our idea,
               we discuss in the group chat on how the game card is going to look like. Since 
               we have sleeves to cover the back of our cards and there is also printing error 
               where the back of the card will not align with the front, my team decide to not include
                it and we make a design of the card where we all agreed on.</p>

            <p class="description">Assignment 1 Diary <br>On 24 may we spent most of our days planning
               on how the cards look like and we also decide on putting a pokemon card at the back of 
               the card to make the card easier to manage instead of having it soft, flexible and 
               hard to manage.</p>

            <p class="description">Assignment 1 Diary <br>On this day me and my team went to the school
               printer to print out the card design there as the school printer have a good colour
                printer which make our card design looks good.  We do have some printing error where there
                 are some paper printed with the wrong name but we use my home printer to print another copy
                  of it to fix the issue. We used my printer which does not have amazing colour like the school printer
                   to fix minor error but it did its job well. On this day we also discovered a lot of issue with the game itself
                    as there are a lot of loop holes in the game where we missed and is currently in a rush to
                     fix. We also remove a few card we agreed were to overpowered and after this we decided
                       our game is finished. We agreed to meet up at my house to test our game for the last
                        time and finished the rest of the task.</p>

            <p class="description">Assignment 1 Diary <br>We meet up at my house at 12am and tested our
               game with different number of people to see if the game can work with 3 players (which we could).
                After the final play test, we begun to work on the rule book where we discuss on how the rule book
                 will look like and what is needed in the book. We do not want the rule book to look dull and also
                  do not want the book to be too lengthy looking so we decide to add pictures to aid in the rule book's looks.
                   We also spent the rest of the time at my house to record some video clips of the game play so that
                    we can use it in our Video pitch.</p>

                 reduce the time of the video and was able to to reduce from 5 min to 2.59.27 minutes

            <p class="description">Assignment 2 Diary <br>On this day I decided on the different game mechanics I would like to implement and 
            decided to work on the double feature first. After watching multiple tutorial, fixing issues which lead my character to be unable to jump 
          when certain action is taken, I finally implemented the double jumpm feature successfully.</p>

            <p class="description">Assignment 2 Diary <br>After a short break, I started working on my game again and created my first attack 
            feature done by my player and create a bunch of NPC to receive damage so that I can make sure my attack feature is working.
            I encountered the same issues with the animation at the start but since I already know how to fix the issue, I am able to fix
           it easily. </p>

            <p class="description">Assignment 2 Diary <br>On this day I implemented the camera function where it will be made and follow my character
            around the map. However after implementing the function to do so, the camera was not working and I am unable to find solutions online 
          so I decide to revert my changes and start over for the camera section. After this incident of reverting, I was lucky to have a extra
         copy saved on my computer, which resulted me in asking friends to teach me how to connect github to my gamemaker so I can make commits 
        for my work. </p>

            <p class="description">Assignment 2 Diary <br> I decided to implement the second attack feature which is meele to my character
             so that my chracter can both meele and shoot at enemies from a far, giving my characters more options to fight the NPCs. I watched
             multiple youtube vides and searched online for ways I can implement it to the game I am making, however I am unable to do so as the 
            tutorials I watch was not suitable for my work. So I scrap the idea and make it just a run and gun game.</p>

            <p class="description">Assignment 2 Diary <br>After playing the game, I thought it would be a good option to add a falling mechanic 
            when I release my spacebar while jumping, making my character fall instantly when I realse the space bar. After implementing this 
          function, I let my friends play test it but most of them felt like it was very restricting and hard to play with, hence , I removed 
        this additional feature.</p>

            <p class="description">Assignment 2 Diary <br>On this day I worked on my menu screen. I watched a tutorial and manage to create 
            a menu page in almost an hour after mastering most of the image editing skills I learnt. After completing the menu page, I added audio 
          to my game. The first audio I implement was the audio for player landing and bow sound effect. I continued by implementing 
        menu background music and I encounterd my first issue with the sound where my game keep looping the music. After looking around and finding
      solutions to the issue, I realised that I put my audio_play function in step instead of create fucntion.</p>

            <p class="description">Assignment 2 Diary <br>I applied all the fuctions in the game with audio and proceeded to add a few more feature
             into the game, a stop watch which stops time and added new enemies to fight. The new entity is a fire wiazrd which can fire 2 
            projectile, have a higher attack speed and a huge Heatlh. The stop watch is added with the intention that the incentive of making to a certain
           part of the area which allows them to be able to complete the level is a easier fashion.</p>

            <p class="description">Assignment 2 Diary <br>I created one boss stage and begin to plan for my story. The story I thought of 
            is that the player is a time traveller and a dimension hopper who lost his memories after time travellig. He was lost so he starts to 
          wander around but is being attacked by NPCs. He attacks in self defense and wonder why he was being attacked. At the end of the game there is two 
        different ending after completeing the game. The blue portal leads to the start of the story where the player is a good guy who helped
       saved the world, however the red portal is a portal where is in the distance future compared to the blue portal. The blue portal is when 
      the player is called the traveller where he travel around time and dimension to help save the world but after millions of years he turns twisted 
    and started to destory the world with the help of Devils from Hell. When the player is the traveller wanting to save the world, he does not know 
  that he is fighting with his future self but the future self knows he is fighting his past self. The two portal leads to two different path in the next 
update of the game where you can play through both the good path and the bad path of the stories with more alternative which can lead to different ending the 
future.</p>

            <p class="description">Assignment 2 Diary <br>After completing my overall game design and the idea for the story, I created a Introduction video 
            so that I can give off a mysterious vibe in the game. I added a lot of signs in the game where it can help give players ideas of the identity of the 
          "Villian" and "Hero" in the game where they are actually the same guy from different timelines. Thus, the reason for the player to be attacked by everyone 
        in game and many signs indicating that the only way the "Hero" and "Villian" can fight is if they use the same ability. If all sign is found the names 
      of the player character in game is "Thrax" and "Traveller", which are names given by the people in the game's lore.</p>

            <p class="description">Assignment 2 Diary <br>After allowing multiple friend from all over the world to try my game, I scaled the game's difficulty in a 
            way where it would take new players around 1 hour to complete the game but people who mastered the game around 5 minute - 15 minutes to finish the game.
          Everyone who played the game have experience in playing fps and platformers so people who plays this game are expected to be decent at platformers as it is 
        made with a certain difficulty from floor 2 the beneth's level where the player need a certain level of skills to complete, or just a lot of patienence. After
       fixing all the issues and bugs in the game my game is finished.</p>
